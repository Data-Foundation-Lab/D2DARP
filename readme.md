## Proof-of-Concept Implementation
**Researcher's Note:** This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of D2DARP, highlighting its key features and workflow. Performance and computational efficiency were not prioritized, and the code has not been thoroughly examined or optimized. The primary goal is to demonstrate the overall workflow. Although an effort was made to keep the implementation code clean, it is only minimally managed due to time constraints.

## D2DARP In Action (Screenshot)
As shown in the image below, the proof-of-concept demonstrates that "Client2" (identifier: 452f24f61652351a75d22574c1f14aa8), highlighted in red, was denied access to the new IP address of the DDevice. Meanwhile, "Client1" (identifier: 8d781da7812048f70b1ed40e9aabd33d), highlighted in blue, was allowed to access the DDevice's new IP address, 10.0.0.1.
